## Welcome to the Aspects of Consciousness lecture series. 

This is the website we use to develop these teaching materials. If you
were looking for the actual materials, [click

### Notes to developers

The files in the _docs_ directory are the live contents of the
_aspects-consciousness_ website. The files are a mix of .md and .pdf. If
you change the .md files, the live contents of the site changes. Use
.md when possible, see below if you need to compile from source.

The .pdf files are created from the .odp files in the _src_
directory. Do not change the .odp files directly. Instead, change the
.odp files, export them and copy the resulting .pdf file into the
_docs_ directory.

## Aspects of consciousness

Two sets of partially interactive sessions on the philosophy and
scientific study of consciousness. One set is introductory, pitched at
first-year undergraduates with little to no previous background in
psychology. The other set is pitched at a higher level, the intended
audience is final-year psychology undergraduates who have chosen to
study consciousness as a course option.
